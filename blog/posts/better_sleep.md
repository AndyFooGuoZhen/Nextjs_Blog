#### Current problems I'm facing

- I'd say I had no trouble with sleeping, but I'm a really light sleeper
- I have inconsistent sleep schedules for the past few weeks, sometimes I wake up at 5 because I wanna feel productive, sometimes I wake up at 8 on the weekends
- I dynamically adjust my sleep time, my alarm for this morning and the next morning may be different as I'm trying to hit at least 7 hours of sleep for the night

##### Leon Hendrix's Video on sleep

- Video shows Leon facing insomnia issues
- He tried to improve his sleep score by exercising in the morning, getting more momemnts of silence during the day , eating less or earlier for dinner
- Conclusion: Look at the root of the sleep problem, behaviorual pattterns are tied to our identity and belief systems

##### Reflection and questions I have about sleep

- Is it more important to get consistent amount of sleep everyday or consistent sleep and wake times?
- What makes a person a light sleeper? Are they not in deep sleep most of the time?
- Is it better to wake up later on the weekends?
- How can I get rid of the dark circles under my eyes? It's always there no matter how long I sleep. Is there something wrong with my sleep that I don't know about? Or are there any other lifestyle habits that I'm not aware of that's causing the dark circles under my eyes
