##### Conventional placement of speakers (Point source)

- Speakers are stacked in a row x grid position
- Requires many speakers to be placed together, creates uneven sound due to interference of speakers placed side by side
- Changes in sounds can be easilly heard when audience is moving from one location to another in a concert venue

##### New speaker placement strategy (Line Array)

- Speakers stacked vertically, placed at strategic locations at a concert venue
- Software allows music technician to pinpoint locations of sounds, allowing for more precise control of sound coverage
- At large music festivals like Coachella, sound coverage must be regulated to prevent sounds from leaking into other stages
- Requires less speakers, changes in sound is hard to detect when audience moves accross the venue
