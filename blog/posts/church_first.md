##### What motivated me to step into a church on a Sunday?

- Being a freethinker, I've never been to church on a Sunday
- I have no idea what christians do in churches on Sundays
- Friend of mine offered me a ride to the church

##### Schedule of events at the church

- People in the church start singing christian worship songs
- Prayers , moments of silence
- Some people came up to discuss parts of the bible (verses), and brought out personal stories they have about their past to relate to the verses

##### Things I've observed at the church

- Christians call each other brothers and sisters
- Christians end their prayers with the word "Amen", which is used to express agreement or approval

##### Questions I have after going to this event

- Is it normal for people to open their eyes while praying? If so, is it bad to do so?
- How do they read the bible? Do they read it like a story book page by page? Or do they randomly select verses from the bible to open a discussion on it?

##### Conclusion / things I've learned from this experience

- I see it as a place where people come together to share their stories, to think deeply about verses in the bible and to care for each other
- I would like to participate more of these kinds of discussions in the future
