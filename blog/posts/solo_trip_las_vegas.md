##### What led to my solo travel in Las Vegas?

- Friend got stuck at an airport for days due to bad weather and I arrived Las Vegas on time

##### Starting out

- With no experience of travelling alone, I felt lonely and a little scared about roaming around alone in the city
- Las Vegas , nicknamed "Sin city" , doesn't feel and sound very safe, travelling alone seems a little risky
- I was getting bored in a hotel the whole day, wanted to try something new and experience what it's like to travel alone without any companions
- Did a little planning and rundown of the places I would like to visit

##### Experiences / travel itenary
- Took an uber to capital one cafe at Fashion Show Mall, did a little work there and eased into my solo travelling journey (Capital one holders get discounted coffees) 
- Walked to Wynn hotels and casinos, wondered what people do in their lives to have the means to spend on designer branded items when I'm just a broke college student 
- Walked to different casinos and hotels just to see their architecture, different casinos have different minimum bets
- Under the hot and schorching sun, I head off to Kimchee, a korean BBQ restaurant for dinner 
- Took another uber back to gold coast hotel and decided to end the day with a small gambling and bowling session

##### Detailed thoughts
- Walking without any companion feels very liberating, I control the pace of my walks and I can head to whatever location that piques my interest. 
- Often times while travelling with others, I don't have the chance to stop and take in the views of my environment. Taking a moment to rest and stand on the sidewalk of Las Vegas strip allows me to "live in the moment". It feels so good to just observe how people interact at a distance, looking at the buzzling traffic and other activities that are currently ongoing on the strip.
- Eating alone at a restaurant is a similar experience as well. I don't have to rush my dinner and I can order just the right amount of food for myself.
