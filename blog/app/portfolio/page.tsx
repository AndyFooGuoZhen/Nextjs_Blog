            Hi there! I'm Andy. I'm currently a student at Iowa State University
            majoring in CS in my senior year. I'm always looking for ways to push
            myself and grow personally by taking on new projects.

            I've built this personal blog to share my thoughts and ideas about
            interesting events of my day or stuff I've found to be impactful from
            the internet. Being relatively new to the blog writing game, I seek to
            improve my writing skills through this blog as well.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="my-5">
            I hope to inspire others to practice the skills of deep thought and
            hope you have a valuable takeaway to bring with you through reading
            some my blogs. So join me on this journey of discovery and let's
            explore the world together. Thanks for stopping by!
